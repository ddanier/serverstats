   graphs / images are broken.

* Have you a complete config in config/ directory?
	->	Copy config.sample/ to config/ will install a simple, but
		usually working config
	->	or set up you own config in config/ directory

* Have you set up the cronjob to update the stats?
	->	Set up a cronjob with like:
	
		* * * * * php /path/to/serverstats/update.php

* Is rrd/ and cache/ writable for the user running the update.php cronjob?
	->	Use 'chown' to set the correct permissions

* Is graph/ writable for the webserver user, which should create the graphs
  here?
	->	Use 'chown' to set the correct permissions

* Have a look at rrd/ directory - is there a .rrd file for every graph?
	->	Run 'php update.php' from commandline to see any errors

* right-click the broken graph image, and select "view image"
	->	This should display a serverstats error message, to help you
