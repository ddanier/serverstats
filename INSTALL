 Version: $Id$
===============================================================================

Homepage: http://serverstats.berlios.de/
Author: David Danier, david.danier@team23.de
Licence: GPL v2

Requirements:

* PHP >= 5.0
  (Serverstats is known to fail with safe_mode enabled, that's because
   safe_mode is broken.)
* RRDtool >= 1.2

Basic Installation:

  Basic Installation will install a few simple graphs which should work without
  any additional configuration (like CPU, RAM, Users...). To find out how to
  get more advanced graphs, have a look at doc/ directory.

Basic Installation Steps:

 1. download latest version from http://serverstats.berlios.de/
 2. extract serverstats archive somewhere in webservers document root
 3. copy or move config.sample/ to config/
 4. graph/ must be writable for the webserver user
 5. cache/ and rrd/ must be writable by the user updating the stats (cronjob)
 6. add update.php to the crontab, for example:

        * * * * * php /path/to/serverstats/update.php
        
if "it doesn't work":

  Have a look at doc/faq.txt, to find out what to do if no graphs are displayed.
        
Advanced Configuration:

  Have a look at doc/ directory, to find out how to configure additional
  graphs or how to write new sources for collecting data.

Advanced Example:

* demo -> http://www.webmasterpro.de/~ddanier/serverstats/demo/
* config -> http://www.webmasterpro.de/~ddanier/serverstats/graph_example.phps

  additional configuration needed for some sources like Traffic, Apache 
  requests/s ...
